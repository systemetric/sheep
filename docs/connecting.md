# Connecting to the Robot

1. Turn on the robot by following the instructions [here](/docs/turning-everything-on.md).
1. Turn on your computer and wait until you reach the Windows desktop.
2. Click on the WiFi icon in the bottom right and connect to `RoboConYYYY-TeamXX` where `YYYY` is the competition year and `XX` is your team number.
3. Navigate to <http://robot.go> in your web browser of choice (**Chrome** or **Firefox** is recommended). You should see an interface similar to this:

From now on, this will be referred to as the **Shepherd Homepage**.
