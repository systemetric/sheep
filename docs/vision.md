# Vision

Computer Vision allows your robots to understand their environment. For the competition, this is used to locate markers. It will give you information about the type of the marker, the distance/angle to the marker, etc.

## Python

To look for markers call `see()`:

```python
markers = R.see()

print(markers)
```

`markers` is a Python list of "marker objects", which each look like the following:

```
[target Marker 0: 0.856m @0.754 degrees
{
  info.type = TARGET
  info.id = 50
  info.owning_team = TEAM.RUBY
  info.target_type = TARGET_TYPE.LAIR
  dist = 0.856
  bearing.y = 0.754
  bearing.x = 1.03e+02
  rotation.y = 5.1
  rotation.x = -11.4
  rotation.z = 9.47
  info = TOO BIG TO PRINT
  detection = TOO BIG TO PRINT
}
]
```

Full reference of the properties are further below but some useful properties are:

| Property                 | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `marker.dist`            | Distance to the marker in metres                                                  |
| `marker.bearing.y`       | The angle your robot needs to turn to get to the marker in degrees                |
| `marker.info.id`         | Numeric code of the marker                                                        |
| `marker.info.type`       | Returns `ARENA` for a wall marker, or `TARGET` for sheep, gems and lair markers.                   |
| `marker.info.owning_team`| Returns the gem colour of the team that owns the marker. For example, calling this on Smaug's lair marker would return `TEAM.RUBY`. |
| `marker.info.target_type` | Returns if the marker is a sheep, gem, or lair marker. If it's none of these, `NONE` will be returned. For example, a sheep marker would return `TARGET_TYPE.SHEEP`. |

## Codes

:::tip
You do not need to use the marker ids themselves for your calculations. Use `marker.type`, `marker.owning_team` and `marker.target_type` instead to find out the information you need (see above).
:::

:::tip
`marker.owning_team` will return the Gem Type of that team, not the team name. For example, for team "Smaug" `marker.owning_team` would return "ruby".
:::

Every april tag has a code:

- April tags 0-39 will be used for cubes. Although only 20 are used in each round, there are another 20 spare in case some get damaged.

- April tags 100+ will around the arena on the walls. See the rules for
  specifics on where around the rules they will be placed

- You do not need to use the marker numbers, and can instead use marker.type and marker.owning_team

| Function    | Codes  |      |
| -------- | ----- | ----
| Arena Marker   | 100 - 123  |  |
| Ruby | 24, 25 | Lair marker - 50 |
| Jade | 26, 27 | Lair marker - 51 |
| Topaz | 28, 29 | Lair marker - 52 |
| Diamond | 30, 30 | Lair marker - 53 |
| Sheep | 0 - 23 |

## Blockly

Blocks for vision can be found in the **Vision** section.

<!--PI_REMOVE-->

Here's an example of a Blockly program that does some basic vision:

<BlocklySnippet img="vissnip.png" width="779" height="188" />
<!--END_PI_REMOVE-->

## Example

After reading the [motors documentation](motors.html) you should be able to create a function which moves your robot by a number of meters as well as turn. We can then use this to write some code where a robot:

- Looks for a marker
- If it can see a marker:

  - Turn so that it is facing the marker
  - Drive the distance to the marker

- If there is no marker in sight turn a bit and look again, maybe there is a marker out of view.

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

def move(distance):
    """The robot drives `distance` meters forwards"""
    print("PUT YOUR MOVE CODE HERE")

def turn(rotation):
    """The robot turns `rotation` degrees"""
    print("PUT YOUR TURN CODE HERE")

while True:
    for marker in R.see():
        turn(marker.bearing.y)  # Face the marker
        move(marker.dist)       # Drive to the marker
    else:
        turn(20)  # The robot didn't see anything and so we turn and maybe see
                  # another marker
```

## The `Marker` object

Details about the markers can be accessed using the following syntax:

```python
markers = R.see()  # returns list of markers which the robot can see

for marker in markers:
    print(marker.dist)       # The distance to the marker in meters
    print(marker.bearing.y)  # The rotation the robot would need to turn to
                             # face the marker
    print(marker.info.id)  # The number of the marker
else:
    print("The robot didn't see any markers and skipped the for loop!")
```

A `Marker` object contains information about a _detected_ marker. It has the following attributes:

| Attribute                   | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

:::tip
Axes are all defined relative to the camera not your robot. Since we have
no way to know how you've mounted your camera. You may need to account for this.
:::

:::tip
You can import `MARKER_TYPE` and `TEAM` from `robot`, for example...  

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

markers = R.see()

for marker in markers:
    if marker.info.owner == robot.MARKER_OWNER.ARENA:
        print(f"Marker {marker.info.id} is owned by the arena")
    elif marker.info.owning_team == R.zone:
        print(f"I own {marker.info.id}")
    else:
        print(f"Marker {marker.info.id} is owned by {marker.info.owning_team}")
```

:::

## The `Camera` object

An interface to the camera is provided incase you want to do additional computer vision.

### Changing the resolution

By default the camera takes pictures at a resolution of **640x480px**. You can change this by setting the `res` parameter.

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

print(f"The current res is set to {R.camera.res}")
R.camera.res = (1920, 1440)
print(f"The current res is set to {R.camera.res}")
```

You must use one of the following resolutions:

- `(640, 480)` _(default)_
- `(1296, 736)`
- `(1296, 976)`
- `(1920, 1088)`
- `(1920, 1440)`

:::tip
Using a higher resolution will increase the amount of time it takes to process the image, but you may be able to see more. Using a smaller resolution will be faster, but markers further away may stop being visible.
:::
::: warning
The resolution values may be different on a USB camera. Please see _Using USB Cameras_ (below) for more information.

### Get data straight from the camera

If you wish to do your own computer vision you can capture frames directly from the camera using `robot.camera.capture()`.

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

image = R.camera.capture()

image.grey_frame # A 2d numpy array of the image data uint8
image.colour_frame # A 3d numpy array of the image data
image.colour_type # The encoding method used to store the colour_frame defaults to 8 bit RGB.
image.time # A `datetime` object representing approximately the capture time.
```
## Using USB cameras

The built-in Pi Camera inside your brain should be great for your robot, however if you would like to use your own USB Camera (perhaps you want to put a camera somewhere else on your robot), you can! 

USB cameras can have slightly different functionality than the built-in Pi Camera, so they'll need some fine tuning before you can use them. The basic steps outlined below should get you up and running.

Please **turn your robot off** before plugging in your USB Camera of choice.

To use a USB camera you will need to initialize the `Robot` with something which inherits from `robot.vision.Camera`. Then just call `R.see()` as you would normally.

```python
import robot
from robot.vision import RoboConUSBCamera

R = robot.Robot(camera=RoboConUSBCamera)

print(R.see())
```

### Setting the resolution

You may now wish to change the resolution of your camera, this can be done the same as before with `R.camera.res = (width,height)`.

::: tip
Some resolutions may not work with your USB camera, as different cameras support different resolutions. Check your camera's documentation. If you try and use a resolution that your camera doesn't support, you will get an error that will state the closest resolution to the value you attempted to use. Try changing your resolution to the value that the error message suggests!
:::

For example, to set a USB Camera's resolution to `800x600`:

``` python
import robot
from robot.vision import RoboConUSBCamera

R = robot.Robot(camera=RoboConUSBCamera)

R.camera.res = (800, 600)
print(R.see())
```

### Calibrating the camera

You will then need to calibrate your USB camera as the distance that it reports will not be accurate. You can do this by changing the value in the `R.camera.focal_lengths` dictionary up or down. By default, the robot will use the focal lengths for a "Logitech C270" camera, it's unlikely this is your camera - so see the steps below on how to calibrate it.

::: tip
Remember that focal lengths vary for different resolutions. You will need to run the calibration code below to find the focal length for each resolution you intend to use with your USB camera.
:::

- Place a marker exactly 1m away from the camera (measure this distance). Make sure there are no other markers in sight of the camera.
- Copy and paste the following code into your editor. Please set the `resolution` value to a resolution you wish to use.

``` python
import robot
from robot.vision import RoboConUSBCamera
R = robot.Robot(camera=RoboConUSBCamera)

resolution = (640, 480)

R.camera.focal_lengths[resolution] = (120, 120) # set the focal lengths to a known bad value
R.camera.res = resolution # set resolution

marker = R.see()[0] # get first marker
d = marker.dist
focal_length = 120 / d # focal length = focal length / distance
print("Focal length is around:",focal_length)
print("Use this in your code to set the correct focal length: R.camera.focal_lengths[resolution] = ("+str(focal_length)+", "+str(focal_length)+")")
```

It's worth noting that this is only an average value. 

The code above will output a focal length value which you should use **before** setting `R.camera.res` or `R.see()`. You can also copy the line of code it produces and paste that into your code to set the focal lengths.

For example, if your focal length was `123` at the resolution of `800x600`, you should use the following lines of code, in the **same order**:

``` python
import robot
from robot.vision import RoboConUSBCamera
R = robot.Robot(camera=RoboConUSBCamera)

R.camera.focal_lengths[resolution] = (123, 123)
R.camera.res = resolution

marker = R.see()[0]
```
