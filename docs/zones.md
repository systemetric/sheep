# Zones

Your code will probably need to look for different markers depending on the zone your robot starts in. Whilst you could have different files for each zone, there's also a property on the robot object for this.

## Python

`R.zone` will be equal to the the start zone of the robot, and will be equal to one of the teams.

| **Team** | **Code** |
| --- | --- |
| Ruby | `robot.TEAM.RUBY` |
| Jade | `robot.TEAM.JADE` |
| Topaz | `robot.TEAM.TOPAZ` |
| Diamond | `robot.TEAM.DIAMOND` |
Here's an example:

```python
import robot

R = robot.Robot()

# ... (get some object called "markers")

if markers[0] == R.zone:
    print("Do something!")
else:
    print("Do something else!")
```

This code checks if the first marker in the list belongs to the current robot.

## Blockly

You can find the zone block in the **Movement** section.
